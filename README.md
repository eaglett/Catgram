# Catgram

Catgram is a social network specialised in Cat images. Only images that contain a cat can be uploaded. The project is written in Swift and implements Firebase Firestore, Storage and Authentication, it also uses Apple Vision.

First you need to log in or create an account. If your input is invalid a banner will be shown. For this feature I used [NotificationBannerSwift](http://cocoadocs.org/docsets/NotificationBannerSwift/1.0.1/).
